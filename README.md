## Professional Experience

### Multi Modal Deep Learning Researcher
**Arizona State University**  
*June 2024 - Present*

- Plant Image Based Health Diagnostics System with BLIP-2 Image Captioning using Vicuna 7B and Gemini API 
  - Trained ResNet50 with PlantVillage Data, obtaining TFLite using ONNx. Integrated with Gemini API as LLM for PoC and reference.
  - Initially trained Googleâ€™s ViT for the same dataset but shifted to SWIN Transformer for Low Level feature extraction due to low accuracy.
  - Integrated SWIN with Vicuna 7B as LLM to obtain plant information, disease/problem, and remedies.

### Automation Engineer
**Bosch Global Software Technologies Pvt. Ltd.**  
*September 2019 - August 2022*

- RF Emission Analysis and Harmonic Anomaly Detection for Automotive Conformance
  - Initiated a website to view and store RF Emission data based on spectrum to compare for conformance analysis using Django.
  - Employed BiLSTM Autoencoder to find anomalies in the emissions and used them to find harmonics of resonant frequencies.
  - Generated reports with plots automatically, taking 10% of the time manually and achieving 85% accuracy.

- Smart Inventory Tracking Using Asset Detection and OCR
  - Developed a website to store inventory data and track the arrival, use, storage, and shipment of packages using Django.
  - Leveraged Computer Vision YOLOv4-tiny algorithm to detect artifacts and Tesseract OCR to detect label data and store it in SQL.
  - Deployed the software on Raspberry Pi 3B+ with Pi SC0818 camera and Barcode Reader, saving 25 hours/week.
